jobqueue is a program for executing jobs in parallel to complete all
jobs as fast as possible. It can be used to distribute a set of jobs to
a specific number of processors and/or machines (nodes).
New jobs are started as older jobs finish. Failed jobs can be automatically
restarted. Jobs can be automatically migrated away from failed nodes.

Run jobqueue -h for more information.

List of features to implement:

	* issue multiple jobs / node (useful for clusters of SMP machines)

	* progress meter

	* simulation mode: no execution

	* randomize node assignment

	* re-run for failed jobs
		* support for node failures -> transfer jobs

	* task graph scheduling
		* pure simulation mode: do only scheduling
